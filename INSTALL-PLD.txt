This file describes how to install CodeIgniter in PLD.

The steps are simple (the package CodeIgniter is installed yet).
1. Create a directory in your ~/public_html, e.g. ci (optional).
2. Copy the /usr/share/CodeIgniter/index.php to the directory (created in step 1).
3. Edit the copied index.php: set the correct path in $application_folder (line 75)
   without trailing slash (e.g. "/home/users/uzsolt/programs/codeigniter").
   This directory can be outside of ~/public_html.
   Please don't change $system_path, it points to system-installed CodeIgniter.
4. Create the $application_folder, and its subdirectories:
	   * config
	   * controllers
	   * models
	   * views
   And optional (but suggested!) directories:
	   * core
	   * errors
	   * helpers
	   * hooks
	   * language
	   * libraries
	   * logs
5. You can populate this directories from /usr/share/CodeIgniter/application (optional).
6. Edit config/*.php (autoload.php, config.php, database.php or whatever do you need).
7. You can access your programs via http://localhost/~USERNAME/ci/index.php
   (`ci' is created in step 1.)
8. Happy programming :)

Or you can use `codeigniter-install' script instead of step 1-7 :)
